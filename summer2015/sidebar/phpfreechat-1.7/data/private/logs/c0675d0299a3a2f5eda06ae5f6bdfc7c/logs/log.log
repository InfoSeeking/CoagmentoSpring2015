ch_lib-p-32	07/11/2014	13:29:11	library_38	Fact or Fiction Paper 	For this assignment, you will write a 5-7 page paper that should examine the accuracy of a non-academic article regarding interpersonal communication.  Non-academic sources for this paper could include, but are not limited to, newspaper or magazine articles, as well as short book chapters.  Examples: Cosmopolitan, Maxim, Vanity Fair, Seventeen, Women’s Health, Men’s Health, “He’s Just Not That Into You”, “It’s Called a Break-Up Because It’s Broken”, “Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus”, or a pre-approved alternate option.  Academic sources can include any interpersonal communication journal article that is and involves some type of empirical research. 	You should utilize at least 1 (ONE) academic journal article about your topic to help in your discussion, though using more might be necessary for some topics.  In your paper, you should briefly explain the main points/purpose of the article.  You should then elect 3 (THREE) pieces of information/advice from the article to compare/contrast to class information and your chosen journal article(s).   	This assignment is an extension of the previous 2 papers written in this class.  Thus, when analyzing the findings of the academic source, you should be critical.  Are the results of the articles generalizable and/or valid? (etc.). Use your experience in analyzing academic articles in your discussion.  	NOTE:  You should tie knowledge you have gained in this class to aid in your evaluation.  You should not evaluate the article based on your own personal experience, but rather through concepts, ideas, and theories discussed in class and found in your research.  Meaning, you should not include your opinion about the topic itself, but simply analyze how the academic and non-academic articles compare.

ch_lib-p-5	07/11/2014	15:14:30		library_7 joins lib-p-5
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:14:34	library_17	its relational dialectics
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:14:40	library_31	i thought we all got 20!

ch_lib-p-5	07/11/2014	15:19:11	library_7	yea lol
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:19:21	library_30	Do you remeber which lecture chaper stereotyping was in?
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:19:47	library_31	im not sure
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:19:53	library_31	were you going to look at our slideshow?
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:22:54	library_30	ya
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:23:55	library_30	ch4 
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:24:06	library_18	how are u doing 
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:24:20	library_30	let's try to find studies dealing with stereotyping different cultures/races
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:24:54	library_30	--> Racial and ethnic stereotypes are among the most pervasive sources of distorted perception in the society.
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:26:27	library_17	wait do u remember the assignment?  Are we picking an overall theme and then talking about all its different categories
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:26:57	library_18	we're picking any concept we talked about in class 
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:26:58	library_17	because relational dialectics is obviously very broad so Im guessing we can go anywhere with the types of articles we pick 
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:27:07	library_18	i discovered the overarching theme for tests and relationship talk 
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:27:13	library_18	its not relational dialectics 
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:27:16	library_18	its relational uncertainty 
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:27:23	library_18	which is why you use secret tests, jealous, and relationship talk 
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:27:34	library_18	to figure more about the relationship without directly asking the partner 
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:27:34	library_17	oh yeah i like that one better because we talked about it alot in comm theory
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:27:42	library_18	yes !
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:27:43	library_31	what is that
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:27:54	library_31	i looked at it from a popculture stand point
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:27:57	library_31	and why we stereotype
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:28:03	library_30	From her lecture notes
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:28:05	library_31	and some of the advantages and disadvsantages
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:28:05	library_18	we we could do relational uncertainty and find articles on the different components of it 
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:28:56	library_31	where are her lecture notes
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:29:04	library_31	did you snip them?
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:29:18	library_30	I bookmarked it
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:30:35	library_17	okay perf! 
ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:31:25	library_30	Since we need 2 journal articles, we can use the first as yours and the second as mine 
ch_lib-p-10	07/11/2014	15:32:13	library_14	your article now?
ch_lib-p-10	07/11/2014	15:32:28	library_14	topic*

ch_lib-p-27	07/11/2014	15:36:04	library_30	Group Assignment (15%): Paper: This group paper is an in-depth literature review of the interpersonal communication topic that you will select from the book. This paper should build on what we have covered and learnt in class. The group will need to find 10-12 relevant journal articles in light of the topic. This cannot be a book or a magazine, but must be a journal that have been published between 2000 and 2014. Not only you need to summarize the articles, but also you need to incorporate them in a coherent way. Summarize a) the goal of the study b) the methods used c) the findings of the study d) implications of the study. Each summary can be one to two paragraphs, and should not be a retelling of the abstract. The final paper should be 8-10 pages in length.  
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:36:17	library_18	whats that 
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:36:17	library_17	I feel like face-to-face is alot simpler than looking at online
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:36:27	library_18	oh yeah deff 
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:36:48	library_18	i found a few things

ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:37:54	library_18	we each need to find 3 articles all on the different aspects of relational uncertainty and then summarize them?
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:38:08	library_18	we can always change our topic too if its too ambiguous/obsure
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:38:13	library_17	I think so! I think she said 9 sources is fine
ch_lib-p-12	07/11/2014	15:38:14	library_18	obscure *

ch_lib-p-35	12/11/2014	15:30:33	library_41	are you having trouble finding stuff?
ch_lib-p-35	12/11/2014	15:31:05	library_41	cause you can literally go to psych info and do a basic search and just type in "patient-centered care breast cancer treatment success" and it comes up with a lot of stuff

ch_lib-p-15	12/11/2014	15:41:57	library_23	definitely focus on brother to sister relationships more than sister siblings and brother siblings
ch_lib-p-15	12/11/2014	15:42:01	library_22	okay, what do you mean about gender though? gender of the siblings effecting comm?
ch_lib-p-15	12/11/2014	15:42:04	library_22	okay gotcha
ch_lib-p-15	12/11/2014	15:42:40	library_23	yes how having a brother-sister sibling relationship differs from same sex sibling relationships
ch_lib-p-35	12/11/2014	15:48:25	library_42	Focus on the effects, and make sure you tie in how communication via technology is important
ch_lib-p-35	12/11/2014	15:48:57	library_42	since it is a major phenomenon in todays society, changing how we interact
ch_lib-p-15	12/11/2014	15:50:32	library_22	okay i keep getting weird sibling incest articles lol what search terms are you using?
ch_lib-p-15	12/11/2014	15:54:53	library_23	lol thats what i  use to get
ch_lib-p-15	12/11/2014	15:55:06	library_23	focus on influence of genderinterpersonal relationships
ch_lib-p-15	12/11/2014	15:55:19	library_23	sibling communication
ch_lib-p-15	12/11/2014	15:55:21	library_22	okay
ch_lib-p-15	12/11/2014	15:55:38	library_23	i always use advance search so that they focus on more key words than incest
